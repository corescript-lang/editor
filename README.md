# Editor
The new Corescript Editor fixes many of the bugs in the old one.

This is an editor for Corescript 0, the initial  
syntax style of Corescript when it was created in 2017.  
It also includes it's own terminal style interface.  

Click on the link to try it out yourself. It is fairly light,  
using no JS libraries.
