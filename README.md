# Editor
The new Corescript Editor fixes many of the bugs in the old one.  

This is an editor for Corescript 0, the initial syntax style of Corescript  
when it was created in 2017.  
It may be a little bit spahgetti code, but I wrote it mostly for fun, with  
support for a custom command block compiler.
